** The software "Qabel" is licensed under the QaPL, a specially developed proprietary license. 
The QaPL can neither be classified according to the standards of
the Free Software Foundation (FSF), nor to the standards of the Open Source Initiative (OSI)
as "Free Software License" or "Open Source License" respectively.

We have decided to do it that way in order to keep the project going, while at the same time
ensuring the greatest possible freedom.

The QaPL does not satisfy the standards of those "Open Source" or "Free Software" licenses,
due to our non-commercialization and non-military clauses.**

Qabel Public License Version 0.2 (QaPL v0.2) (c) Qabel GmbH, Hannover

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license agreement. You may
also use content from it for your own license agreement. Unless not expressly
stated, you may not use the name Qabel Public License ("QaPL") in connection
with any license agreement that is not a verbatim copy of This License.

PREAMBLE Today Software is the undisputed centerpiece of the information
society and access to software and information society services became a public
commodity. Yet traditional software is made available in object code only,
where the software user is not entitled to study or even modify the source
code. We believe that this is a salient shortcoming in particular when it comes
to software which is designed to help the user protect his privacy in a virtual
world. A proprietary software developer who refuses to unveil the source code
of its security software, requires users to place a great deal of faith into
the computer program and its ability to protect personal data. Not only because
trust in conventional software security was all too often disappointed, we have
decided to replace "trust" with "transparency" and everybody is welcome to
study, modify and improve the source code of this software. Furthermore, and
although we believe in the idea of free software, we have decided to make two
important exceptions, to wit, QaPL-licensed software should neither be used
commercially without our consent, nor for military, intelligence or related
purposes. By that we hope to make it a powerful, self sustaining and constantly
evolving tool that helps to reinforce data security and the protection of
personal data. However, it shall be up to the user to decide whether he finds
this software fit for the purpose.
